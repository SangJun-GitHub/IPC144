1)In one or two sentences explain why the arrays in this program have to be declared to hold 10 elements?
When initializing an array and the number of elements initialized is less than the elements in the array.
it will be hard to get correct number because program will try to find elements initialized outside of array.

2)In two or three sentences explain the advantages and disadvantages of using matching arrays?
Advantages: 
It is used to represent multiple data items of same type by using only single name.
It can be used to implement other data structures like linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, graphs etc.
Disadvantages:
I must know in advance that how many elements are to be stored in array.
Since array is of fixed size, if I allocate more memory than requirement then the memory space will be wasted. And if I allocate less memory than requirement, then it will create problem.
The elements of array are stored in consecutive memory locations. So insertions and deletions are very difficult and time consuming.

3)Was the at home portion of this workshop too easy, just right or too hard? Why? 
it was too hard because when i missing the arrays everything is changed completly.
