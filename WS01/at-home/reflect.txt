1 - Name the four most common types of C language and their size in bytes.
char - 1byte
int - 4bytes
float - 4bytes
double  - 8bytes

2 - Name the ¡°int¡±  Size Specifiers and their size in bytes.
Short - 2bytes
Long  - 4bytes 
Long long  - 8bytes

3 - Write a C statement; declare an integer variable called ¡°age¡± and initialize it to 24;
 int main() 
{
int age;
age = 24;
return 0;
}

4 - Write ONE C statement and declare two constant double variables called PI and G. Initialize PI to 3.14159265 and G to 9.8.
 int main()
{
const double PI, G;
PI = 3.14159265;
G = 9.8;
return 0;
}

5 - What is the name of the escape sequence ¡°\t¡±; 
horizontal tab

6 - write a function-call to read an integer number from keyboard and place it in a variable called ¡°num¡±; (scanf)
 int main() 
{
int num;
scanf(¡°%d¡±,  num);
return 0;
}

7 - write a function-call to print the value of a double variable called ¡°balance¡±. (printf)
printingBalance()
{
double balance;
printf(¡°%lf¡±, balance);
}

8 - What are the values of A and B after these statements:
int A, B = 10;
A = B++;

A=11
B=10

9 -In one sentence explain what is ¡°casting¡± in C language.
The C language supports conversions from one type to another.  
To convert the type of an operand, we precede the operand with the target type enclosed within parentheses.
We call such an expression a cast.
