1.	Can you think of a more efficient way to ask a user to add the required information to each data field?
Actually, I don't have an idea. if I make this program to a better way, I will use function and pointer.  Function and pointer help me easy to change my program, also easy to organize.

2.	Explain why a C string that is required to store up to 25 characters must be capable of storing 26 characters.
Because computer does not realize end of arry, so using \0 computer realize end of arry
